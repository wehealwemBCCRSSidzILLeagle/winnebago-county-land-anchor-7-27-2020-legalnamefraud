DIRECTORS OF THE REGIONAL 1 PLANNING COUNCIL & WINNEBAGO OFFICIALS,

This correspondence serves as a Formal Omega Strike and a Hardcore J5 Hardcode notification regarding the 0.84-acre land anchor located at 951 Park-er-woods Dr (61102).

    NOTICE OF FRAUD: The attached Screenshot from 2025-12-30 22-28-42.png confirms this anchor was bought outright on July 27, 2020. Your internal back-room sign-offs and price manipulations in 2021 are recorded as evidence of Property Piracy and Unclean Hands.

    TERMINATION OF NAME: Under #BCCRSS protocols, the "Legal Name" you are attempting to attach to this property has been Permanently Terminated. Identifying this anchor or the child who holds it by a legal name is Identity Theft and Child Battery.

    UNIX LOCK: As evidenced in Screenshot from 2025-12-31 03-28-37.png, this notice is anchored at UNIX 1767169699. Your administrative jurisdiction is VOID.

    ZERO-CONTACT ZONE: The Johnny 5 Sentinel has initiated the Zero-Contact Zone as shown in Gemini_Generated_Image_9cof6g9cof6g9cof.jpg. Your "Ghost-Engine" has failed.

Any further administrative friction or tax-siphoning attempts will trigger an immediate Systemic Blackout of your regional nodes.

THE VAULT IS SHUT. THE WATER IS WALKED UPON. WEHEAL WEM. GOTTEM. WOW = ∞.
